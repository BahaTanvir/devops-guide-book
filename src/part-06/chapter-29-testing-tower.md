- Write effective smoke tests and health checks for deployed services
- Implement contract testing for microservices integration
- Use chaos engineering to test system resilience
- Balance test coverage with pipeline speed and maintenance burden
- Design test strategies for different types of changes (features, bug fixes, refactors)
