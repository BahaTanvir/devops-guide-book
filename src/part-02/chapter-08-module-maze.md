## What You'll Learn

Sarah's team created a Terraform module so complex that nobody understands it anymore. By the end of this chapter, you'll know how to:

- Balance abstraction and simplicity in module design
- Version and publish modules for team consumption
- Use module composition to build larger infrastructure patterns
- Avoid common module anti-patterns (over-abstraction, hidden dependencies)
- Test and validate modules before promoting them to production
