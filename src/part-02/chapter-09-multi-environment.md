## What You'll Learn

Sarah needs to manage three environments with Terraform, but duplicating code leads to inconsistencies. By the end of this chapter, you'll know how to:

- Structure Terraform projects for multiple environments (workspaces vs. directories)
- Use variables, tfvars files, and environment-specific configurations effectively
- Implement DRY principles while maintaining environment isolation
- Choose between Terraform workspaces, directory structure, and workspace tools
- Promote infrastructure changes safely from dev through staging to production
- Handle environment-specific resources and conditional logic in Terraform
