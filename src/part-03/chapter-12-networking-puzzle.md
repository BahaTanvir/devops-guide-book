## What You'll Learn

Sarah's pods can't communicate with each other, and external traffic isn't reaching the services. By the end of this chapter, you'll know how to:

- Understand Kubernetes networking fundamentals (CNI, pod-to-pod, service networking)
- Configure Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) for different access patterns
- Use Ingress controllers to route external HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- Implement NetworkPolicies for pod-level security and traffic control
- Debug networking issues with `kubectl`, `curl`, and network tools
- Choose the right service mesh or ingress solution for your needs
