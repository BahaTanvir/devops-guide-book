# Chapter 19: The Tracing Trail

> *"In microservices, a single request becomes a journey. Tracing maps that journey."*

## What You'll Learn

A request is slow, but Sarah can't tell which service is the bottleneck. By the end of this chapter, you'll know how to:

- Implement distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, or Zipkin
- Instrument applications to propagate trace context across services
- Analyze traces to identify latency bottlenecks and dependency failures
- Correlate traces with logs and metrics for complete observability
- Use sampling strategies to balance overhead and coverage
- Debug complex microservice interactions using trace visualization
