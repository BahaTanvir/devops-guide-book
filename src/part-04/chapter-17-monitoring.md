- Implement Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization
- Choose the right metrics to track (RED, USE, Four Golden Signals)
- Create effective dashboards that surface problems quickly
- Use service-level indicators (SLIs) to measure what users care about
- Avoid vanity metrics and focus on actionable observability
