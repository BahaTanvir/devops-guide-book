## What You'll Learn

Sarah faces a complex production issue that defies easy diagnosis. By the end of this chapter, you'll know how to:

- Use debugging tools effectively (`kubectl exec`, `kubectl port-forward`, ephemeral containers)
- Correlate signals across logs, metrics, and traces to find root causes
- Reproduce issues reliably in non-production environments
- Document debugging sessions for knowledge sharing and post-mortems
- Know when to escalate vs. when to dig deeper
