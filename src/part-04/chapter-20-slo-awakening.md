## What You'll Learn

Sarah's team argues about whether the system is "reliable enough"—but they have no objective measure. By the end of this chapter, you'll know how to:

- Define Service Level Indicators (SLIs), Objectives (SLOs), and Agreements (SLAs)
- Choose appropriate SLIs that reflect user experience
- Set realistic SLOs based on business needs and technical constraints
- Calculate error budgets and use them to balance velocity and reliability
- Implement SLO-based alerting and incident prioritization
- Use SLOs to drive architectural and operational decisions
