- Implement secrets rotation policies and automation
- Detect and prevent secrets from being committed to version control
- Respond to secrets exposure incidents (revoke, rotate, audit)
- Design applications that fetch secrets at runtime, not build time
- Apply the principle of least privilege to secrets access
