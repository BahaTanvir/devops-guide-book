## What You'll Learn

Sarah learns that a compromised pod can access services it shouldn't—lateral movement is too easy. By the end of this chapter, you'll know how to:

- Use service meshes (Istio, Linkerd) for mutual TLS and zero-trust networking
- Configure egress controls to limit outbound connections
- Detect and respond to network-based attacks
- Apply defense-in-depth with multiple layers of network security
- Design security architectures that assume breach and limit blast radius
